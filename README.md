# Stock Analysis Project 
This project is a stock analysis tool developed in VBA. It provides analysis of stock data from multiple years using three different worksheets: 2018, 2019, and 2020. 

## Project Description 
The primary purpose of this project is to calculate various metrics for each stock, such as the start price, end price, yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume. This analysis is performed for each stock on all three worksheets. The project also utilizes loop structures to iterate through the data and process each stock efficiently. In addition, techniques learned from w3schools were used to count the last row and compare fields to obtain the desired results. Styling and conditional formatting were applied in VBA to enhance the visual presentation of the data. 

## Usage 
To use this stock analysis tool, follow these steps: 
1. Open the Excel file.
2. Ensure that macros are enabled.
3. [Select the desired worksheet](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m2/lms/starter/Starter_Code.zip) (2018, 2019, or 2020).
4. Click on the "Developer" button.
5. Click on Visual Basic.
6. Perform your code in module.
7. Review the generated analysis report.
