# Stock Analysis Project 
This project is a stock analysis tool developed in VBA. It provides analysis of stock data from multiple years using three different worksheets: 2018, 2019, and 2020. 
## Project Description The primary purpose of this project is to calculate various metrics for each stock, such as the start price, end price, yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume. This analysis is performed for each stock on all three worksheets. The project also utilizes loop structures to iterate through the data and process each stock efficiently. In addition, techniques learned from w3schools were used to count the last row and compare fields to obtain the desired results. Styling and conditional formatting were applied in VBA to enhance the visual presentation of the data. ## Usage To use this stock analysis tool, follow these steps: 1. Open the Excel file. 2. Ensure that macros are enabled. 3. Select the desired worksheet (2018, 2019, or 2020). 4. Click on the "Start Analysis" button. 5. Wait for the analysis to complete. 6. Review the generated analysis report. 
## Key Features - Calculation of start price, end price, yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume for multiple stocks. - Efficient data processing using loops. - Utilization of techniques learned from w3schools to count the last row and compare fields. - Styling and conditional formatting for improved data representation. ## Dependencies The following software and libraries are required to run this project: - Microsoft Excel (Version XXX or higher) - VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)
